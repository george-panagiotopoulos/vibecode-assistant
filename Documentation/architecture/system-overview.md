## High-Level Components

### Frontend Layer (React)
- **Technology**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom vibe color palette
- **State Management**: React hooks and context API
- **Communication**: RESTful API calls to backend

### Backend Layer (Flask)
- **Technology**: Python Flask with service-oriented architecture
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Services**: Modular service layer for business logic
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management

### Data Layer
- **Neo4j**: Graph database for complex relationships and code analysis
- **File System**: Local storage for logs and temporary files
- **External APIs**: GitHub API and AWS Bedrock integration

### External Services
- **AWS Bedrock**: Claude AI models for text generation
- **GitHub API**: Repository access and code analysis
- **Neo4j Database**: Graph data storage and querying

## Architecture Patterns

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
The backend follows SOA principles with distinct services:
- **BedrockService**: AI model interactions
- **GitHubService**: Repository management
- **Neo4jService**: Data persistence
- **PromptService**: Prompt management
- **ConfigService**: Configuration handling

### Component-Based Frontend
React components are organized by feature:
- **PromptBuilder**: Core prompt creation interface
- **GitHubIntegration**: Repository connection and analysis
- **ConfigPanel**: Settings and configuration management

### Event-Driven Communication
- Frontend uses event-driven patterns for user interactions
- Backend services communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses

## Data Flow Architecture

### Request Flow
1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with React components
2. **API Call**: Frontend makes HTTP requests to Flask backend
3. **Service Processing**: Backend routes requests to appropriate services
4. **External Integration**: Services interact with external APIs/databases
5. **Response**: Data flows back through the same path

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Graph Data**: Code relationships and analysis stored in Neo4j
- **Configuration**: User settings and application config in JSON files
- **Logs**: Structured logging to file system
- **Cache**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- GitHub token-based authentication for repository access
- AWS IAM credentials for Bedrock service access
- Environment variable management for sensitive data

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization at API boundaries
- Secure communication with external services
- No sensitive data logging or storage

### Network Security
- HTTPS communication for all external API calls
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
- Rate limiting and request validation

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless backend services enable horizontal scaling
- Load balancing capabilities for multiple backend instances
- Database connection pooling for efficient resource usage

### Performance Optimization
- Streaming responses for real-time user experience
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for long-running operations

### Resource Management
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Memory management for large repository analysis
- Efficient data structures for graph operations
