## New Button Functionality

### üìã Maximum Detail Button

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive step-by-step implementation guides with NFR compliance

**Key Features**:
- **Step Count**: 15-25 detailed steps (enforced by system prompt)
- **Content**: Specific, actionable instructions with technical details
- **NFR Integration**: **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT** - Each step must include detailed instructions on how to satisfy the most relevant non-functional requirements from the provided list
- **Context Integration**: Includes all inputs (NFRs, selected files, user prompt)
- **Token Limit**: 6,000 tokens (increased for detailed content)
- **Structure**: Numbered list with clear explanations and NFR compliance guidance

**System Prompt**:
```
You are an expert AI coding assistant specializing in comprehensive implementation planning. 
Create detailed step-by-step implementation guides that contain between 15-25 specific, 
actionable steps. Each step should include technical details, code examples where appropriate, 
and clear explanations. 

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: For each step in your plan, you must provide detailed instructions 
on how to satisfy the most relevant non-functional requirements from the provided list. 
Explicitly reference which NFRs apply to each step and provide specific implementation 
guidance to meet those requirements.

Consider all provided context including non-functional requirements, selected files, 
and project constraints, ensuring NFR compliance is addressed throughout the implementation.
```

**Use Cases**:
- Complex project implementations requiring NFR compliance
- Detailed technical documentation with quality requirements
- Comprehensive development roadmaps with constraints
- Training and educational materials with best practices

### üìù Balanced Button

**Purpose**: Create balanced step-by-step implementation plans

**Key Features**:
- **Step Count**: Approximately 10 key steps
- **Content**: Clear, actionable, focused on essential details
- **Context Integration**: Includes all inputs (NFRs, selected files, user prompt)
- **Token Limit**: 3,000 tokens (moderate for balanced content)
- **Structure**: Numbered list with concise explanations

**System Prompt**:
```
You are an expert AI coding assistant specializing in balanced implementation planning. 
Create clear, actionable step-by-step plans with approximately 10 key steps that cover 
the most important aspects of the development task. Focus on the essential implementation 
details while maintaining clarity and conciseness.
```

**Use Cases**:
- Standard project planning
- Quick implementation overviews
- Team coordination and planning
- Project milestone definition

### ‚ú® Key Requirements Button

**Purpose**: Rephrase user requirements with clarity and provide condensed NFR summary

**Key Features**:
- **Content**: Requirements clarification and NFR summarization
- **Focus**: Enhanced clarity of user intent + condensed comma-separated NFR list
- **Context Integration**: Includes all inputs (NFRs, selected files, user prompt)
- **Token Limit**: 2,000 tokens (focused for requirements clarification)
- **Structure**: Two-part output - clarified requirement + condensed NFR list

**System Prompt**:
```
You are an expert AI coding assistant specializing in requirements clarification. 
Your task is to:
1. Rephrase the user's requirement with enhanced clarity and precision
2. Provide a condensed, comma-separated list of the selected non-functional requirements

Focus on making the user's intent crystal clear while presenting the NFRs in a concise, 
easily digestible format. Do not provide implementation steps - only clarify what needs 
to be built and what constraints must be satisfied.
```

**Use Cases**:
- Project scoping and requirements clarification
- Stakeholder communication and alignment
- Quick requirement summaries for documentation
- NFR constraint identification and communication

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/components/PromptBuilder.js`)

1. **Button Labels Updated**:
   - `'full_specification'` ‚Üí `'maximum_detail'`
   - `'plan'` ‚Üí `'balanced'`
   - `'clarity'` ‚Üí `'key_requirements'`

2. **System Prompts Enhanced**:
   - Each enhancement type has a specialized system prompt
   - Prompts include specific step count requirements
   - Context integration instructions added

3. **Token Limits Optimized**:
   - Maximum Detail: 6,000 tokens
   - Balanced: 3,000 tokens
   - Key Requirements: 2,000 tokens

4. **Context Integration Improved**:
   - Non-functional requirements automatically included
   - Selected files context added to prompts
   - Specific instructions appended based on enhancement type

### Backend Changes (`backend/services/prompt_constructor.py`)

1. **New Enhancement Types Support**:
   - Added `enhancement_type` parameter to `construct_enhanced_prompt()`
   - Created `_get_system_prompt_for_enhancement()` method
   - Updated `_build_enhancement_instructions()` with type-specific logic

2. **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
   - Maximum Detail: 15-25 steps with detailed categories
